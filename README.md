# Leticia Mooney
- 👋 Hi, I’m @LeticiaMooney! Welcome, traveller.
- 👀 **I’m an Australian author** ✒️ whose works focus on place-making, place-taking, and place-being. I'm obsessed by human nature. I work in a multitude of forms from essays to poetry. 
- 💰**I work as** a coach for entrepreneurial creatives who want to Art more than Work. Other services I offer include compliance consulting (ISO 9001:2015 in particular), professional writing and editing. I have worked as a professional writer and editor for 20+ years. Hit me up if you need someone like me!
- 💞️ **I’m looking to collaborate on artistic works** with other artists: Writers, illustrators. Right now my jam is how we connect with spirit/God. 
- **My latest book** was independently published. It's titled *Liminal Woman*, and is available in all good bookstores. **Stay up to date** with my work by [subscribing to one of my newsletters, which include the amazing Dear Artist series](https://leticiamooney.com/newsletter).
