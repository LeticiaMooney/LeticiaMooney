# Leticia Mooney
- 👋 Hi, I’m @LeticiaMooney! Welcome, traveller.
- 👀 **I’m an Australian author** ✒️ whose works focus on place-making, place-taking, and place-being. I'm obsessed by nature. I work in a multitude of forms from essays to poetry. 
- 💰**I work as** a life reader (tarot, numerology) and writer therapist.  
- 💞️ **I’m looking to collaborate on artistic works** with other artists: Writers, illustrators. Currently I'm working in poetic form most often, and the subjects I'm tackling are weather reading, occult subjects and artistic recovery.
