# Leticia Mooney
- 👋 Hi, I’m @LeticiaMooney! Welcome, traveller.

- 💰**I work as** a coach for  entrepreneurial creatives who want to Art more than Work. I'm also a compliance consultant, and writer/editor for hire. Hit me up if you need someone like me!
- 💞️ **I’m looking to collaborate on artistic works** with other artists: Writers, illustrators. Currently I'm working in poetic form most often. I tackle matrescence, the nature of life and interactions with people, motherhood, and how we connect with spirit.
