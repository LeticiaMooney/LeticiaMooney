# Leticia Mooney
- 👋 Hi, I’m @LeticiaMooney! Welcome, traveller.
- 👀 **I’m an Australian author** ✒️ whose works focus on place-making, place-taking, and place-being. I'm obsessed by nature. I work in a multitude of forms from essays to poetry. 
- 💰**I work as** a coach for creatives (particularly writers), a consultant, a speaker, life reader (tarot, numerology) and an editor for academics (chiefly in engineering).
- 💞️ **I’m looking to collaborate on artistic works** with other artists: Writers, illustrators. Currently I'm working in poetic form most often. I tackle matrescence, the nature of life and interactions with people, motherhood, and how we connect with spirit. 
- **My latest book** was published by Lionstower as *Artist in Recovery*; it's since been pulled from the publisher due to circumstances beyond my control, and is looking for a new home... otherwise it'll be self-published. **Stay up to date** with my work by [subscribing to my newsletter](https://leticiamooney.com/newsletter).
